## Villager AI injected-tier module scaffold (Story villager-ai-001, ADR-0001
## primary, ADR-0008 secondary for the FSM state set).
##
## Owns exactly two things at this story's scope: the [enum State] six-state
## agent machine (Deciding/Traveling/Working/Sleeping/Breather/Wandering,
## ADR-0008 Decision §1) and the tick-driven `match` dispatch skeleton that
## will carry each state's real behaviour in later stories -- every branch
## body is an empty stub here (`_tick_deciding`/`_tick_traveling`/
## `_tick_working`/`_tick_sleeping`/`_tick_breather`/`_tick_wandering`), per
## this story's explicit Out of Scope: walkability (story 002), the Deciding
## scheduler queue/budget (story 005), and the priority decision logic
## (story 006) are NOT implemented here.
##
## Injected-tier module (ADR-0001): [member config] and [member voxel_world]
## are wired via a scene file's Inspector in production, or assigned
## directly in a headless test; all wiring/validation lives in [method setup],
## never `_ready()`. [member time_tick_system] is the one deliberate
## exception to "typed `@export`" -- see that field's own doc comment for why
## it mirrors [GameWorld]'s existing `resource_item_database` duck-typed
## pattern instead.
##
## Dispatch is driven EXCLUSIVELY by [member time_tick_system]'s `tick`
## signal (ADR-0008 Decision §2, Control Manifest Feature Layer: "tick-driven
## via Time & Tick's signal, never raw delta") -- this class defines no
## `_process`/`_physics_process` override anywhere, so the "never raw delta"
## guarantee holds structurally rather than by a conditional bypass (the same
## structural-guarantee style `CameraInput`'s raw-delta contract already
## established for this codebase).

## The six-state agent machine (GDD "States and Transitions" table; ADR-0008
## Decision §1 Architecture Diagram). Exactly these six and no others
## [TR-villager-ai-behavior-... state table]. Per-villager state is driven by
## `match` on [method _tick_state], never a behavior tree or utility-scored
## alternative (ADR-0008 Alternatives B/C, rejected).
enum State {
	DECIDING,
	TRAVELING,
	WORKING,
	SLEEPING,
	BREATHER,
	WANDERING,
}

## Tuning config dependency (ADR-0002). Wired via a scene file's Inspector in
## production, or assigned directly in a headless test. Never read inside
## `_ready()` -- see [method setup]. No gameplay value is ever hardcoded in
## this module -- every tunable is read from this config once later stories
## give the state bodies real behaviour [TR-villager-ai-behavior-090].
@export var config: VillagerAIConfig

## Voxel World dependency (ADR-0001), typed `@export` since [VoxelWorldGrid]
## is itself an injected-tier module (not an Autoload) -- wired via a scene
## file's Inspector in production, or assigned directly in a headless test.
## Unused by this story's stub state bodies (walkability reads are story
## 002's scope); asserted as wired in [method setup] regardless, since every
## later story's `_tick_traveling`/`_tick_working`/etc. body will need it and
## the DI wiring point belongs on this scaffold from day one, not
## re-threaded per story.
@export var voxel_world: VoxelWorldGrid

## Time & Tick System dependency (ADR-0001 Autoload tier). Deliberately a
## plain, non-`@export` `Object` -- `@export`ing an Autoload into any module
## is Forbidden (ADR-0001) -- mirroring [GameWorld]'s existing
## `resource_item_database` duck-typed field exactly: production leaves this
## `null` and [method setup] resolves it lazily against
## `/root/TimeTickSystem` (the real Autoload, registered project-wide); a
## headless test assigns a `tick`-signal-shaped test double directly before
## calling [method setup], with zero scene tree and zero manual Autoload
## registration of its own. Duck-typed against exactly one member this class
## depends on: `signal tick()`.
var time_tick_system: Object = null

## Current agent state (GDD "States and Transitions": Deciding is every
## agent's loop-start entry). Read-only from outside this class -- see
## [method get_state].

var _is_set_up: bool = false


## Explicitly callable wiring/validation entry point (ADR-0001). Asserts
## [member config], [member voxel_world], and a
## [member time_tick_system]-shaped dependency are all wired, applies
## ADR-0002's clamp+warn `validate()` policy, then connects this module's
## tick dispatch to the SOLE global tick broadcast (`TimeTickSystem.tick`,
## per that Autoload's own doc comment) -- never a per-villager `Timer` or
## raw-delta poll.
